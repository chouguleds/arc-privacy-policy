## Designed for Everyone â™¿

While **Arc** is a powerful productivity tool for everyone, it was built on a foundation of accessibility. It serves as an essential assistive tool for users with dyslexia, low vision, and other reading challenges by making digital content more digestible and audible.

We believe that by building for accessibility first, we create a product that is more robust and useful for all.

## How It Works

1. **Enable the floating sidebar** from any app
2. **Tap to summarize** the content on your screen
3. **Listen** to the content read aloud, or **save** it for later
4. **Organize** your saved summaries with categories and search

## Privacy First

Your data belongs to you. Arc processes screen content only when you explicitly request it, and never stores it on our servers. All saved content is stored locally on your device. Optional Google Drive backup gives you control over your data.
