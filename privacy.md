## Introduction

Welcome to Arc. This policy explains how we handle your data with transparency and care. Our goal is to provide powerful features while respecting your privacy at every step.

---

## Our Core Privacy Promise

Arc is built to be private by design. Our fundamental promise about how we handle your screen content is:

* **Content is Processed, Never Stored:** When you request an AI summary, the text from your screen is sent to an AI service for processing. It is **never stored, saved, or logged on our servers.**
* **You Are in Control:** The app only accesses screen content when you explicitly tap an action in the floating sidebar. It never monitors your screen in the background.

---

## 1. Information We Handle and Why

To provide our service, we handle two types of information: data you provide for account features and data we process for core functionality.

### 1.1 Data You Provide for Optional Account Features

Arc is fully functional without an account. However, to enable optional features like cross-device backup, we use Google Sign-In.

* **Google Account Information:** If you choose to sign in, we collect your **Google ID** and **Email Address**. This information is stored securely on our backend servers (hosted on AWS DynamoDB) and is used solely to identify your account for features like Google Drive backup and to prepare for future premium services. We do **not** collect your full name or profile picture.
* **Saved Content:** Summaries and screenshots you explicitly save are stored **encrypted only on your device**.

### 1.2 Data We Process for Core Functionality

* **On-Screen Content:** When you request a summary or use the "Read Aloud" feature, the app temporarily processes the text content on your screen. This data is sent ephemerally to our AI partners and is immediately discarded after processing.
* **Anonymous Technical Data:** To fix bugs and improve the app, we collect anonymous, non-personal data like device model, OS version, and crash logs. This data is not linked to your identity.

## 2. Third-Party Services & Data Sharing

We use reputable third-party services and only share the minimum data necessary.
